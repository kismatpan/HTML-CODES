    <h3>
      Is the name of our project.Basically using these project a ordinary people can take advantage,in the sense of preventing the robberies of fuel from vehicle and vehicle while it's moving or when robber try to robb the vehicle
    </h3>
    <h3>It has application in Transport vehicals, Cars and all other vehicles. This project has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things"target="_main">IOT</a> which send the notification to owner of vehicle when there is fuel theft going on. Vehicle fuel theft is one of the main concerns of many vehicle owners. Many times we have heard or some of us have already faced that petrol/diesel from their vehicle has been stolen. Main intention of this project is to avoid such situation. In IOT based fuel theft detection system, we have used a Level sensor to detect the petrol level in petrol tank. If the level goes below certain threshold level then this sensor gives a particular signal to the microcontroller. Then microcontroller turns on the buzzer and sends Notification to the Vehicle owner.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller" target="_main">Microcontroller</a>  is a main heart  of this Project</h3>
